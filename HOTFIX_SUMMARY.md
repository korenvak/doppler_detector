# Hotfix: Time Axis Display and Event Marking Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Event Marking Failed with "Cannot mark" Error**
- **Problem**: When loading files that don't match the expected naming pattern, `file_start` was `None`, preventing event marking
- **Solution**: Added fallback to use current time as start timestamp when filename parsing fails
- **Impact**: Event marking now works for ALL files, regardless of naming

### 2. **Time Axis Showed Raw Seconds**
- **Problem**: When no start timestamp available, axis showed raw seconds (e.g., "536.23")
- **Solution**: Enhanced fallback display to show relative time in HH:MM:SS format
- **Impact**: Much cleaner display even for files without proper naming

### 3. **Missing End Timestamp Calculation**
- **Problem**: When filename parsing failed, end timestamp was not calculated
- **Solution**: Calculate end timestamp from audio duration when not available from filename
- **Impact**: Proper duration display for all files

## Code Changes

### `/workspace/spectrogram_gui/gui/main_window.py`
```python
# Added fallback for files without proper naming:
start_timestamp = datetime.now()  # Use current time as fallback
# Calculate end timestamp from audio duration:
if end_timestamp is None and start_timestamp is not None and len(times) > 0:
    duration_seconds = times[-1]
    end_timestamp = start_timestamp + timedelta(seconds=duration_seconds)
```

### `/workspace/spectrogram_gui/gui/spectrogram_canvas.py`
```python
# Enhanced time display fallback to show HH:MM:SS format:
if self.start_dt is None:
    # Convert seconds to HH:MM:SS format
    hours = int(total_seconds // 3600)
    minutes = int((total_seconds % 3600) // 60)
    seconds = int(total_seconds % 60)
    out.append(f"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}:{seconds:02d}")
```

## Testing

The fixes ensure that:

1. **Files WITH proper naming** (e.g., `pixel - 211 - 2025-19-08 10-19-59 - 2025-19-08 10-28-55`):
   - Show absolute datetime on axis (e.g., "2025-08-19 10:19:59")
   - Event marking uses actual file times
   - CSV exports have correct absolute times

2. **Files WITHOUT proper naming** (e.g., `recording_001.wav`):
   - Show relative time on axis in HH:MM:SS format (e.g., "00:03:45")
   - Event marking works using current time as reference
   - CSV exports use current time + offset

## Backward Compatibility

✅ All changes are backward compatible
✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
✅ Files with proper naming get full benefits
✅ Files without proper naming still work correctly
