# Modern GUI Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes applied to the modern GUI to resolve the reported issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Spectrogram Display - Inverted Axes ✅
**Problem:** The spectrogram was displaying with opposite/inverted axes (frequency and time swapped).

**Solution:**
- Fixed in `/workspace/spectrogram_gui/gui_modern/spectrogram_canvas.py`
- Added proper transpose of the spectrogram data (line 340: `self.Sxx_display = Sxx_norm.T`)
- Removed incorrect `axisOrder='col-major'` setting
- Fixed scaling calculations to match transposed data dimensions

### 2. Detection Dialogs and Plots ✅
**Problem:** Detection dialogs didn't match the old GUI logic and plots weren't working.

**Solutions:**

#### A. Created Fixed Detector Dialog
- Created `/workspace/spectrogram_gui/gui_modern/detector_dialog_fixed.py`
- Properly implements all DopplerDetector parameters:
  - Frequency range (freq_min, freq_max)
  - Power threshold and peak prominence
  - Gap handling parameters
  - Frequency jump limits
  - Track filtering parameters
  - Track merging parameters
- Correctly updates detector instance when OK is clicked

#### B. Added Detection Plotting
- Added `plot_auto_tracks()` and `clear_auto_tracks()` methods to modern spectrogram canvas
- Tracks are displayed as yellow lines overlaid on the spectrogram
- Properly initialized `auto_tracks_items` list for track management

#### C. Fixed Detection Integration
- Updated `show_detector_dialog()` in main window to create and use DopplerDetector
- Implemented proper `run_detection()` method that:
  - Uses the actual detector with current spectrogram data
  - Converts detection results to displayable tracks
  - Plots tracks on the spectrogram canvas

### 3. Filter Dialogs ✅
**Problem:** Filter dialogs weren't integrated with the audio processing pipeline.

**Solution:**
- Created `/workspace/spectrogram_gui/gui_modern/filter_dialog_fixed.py`
- Implements high-pass, low-pass, and band-pass filters
- Properly integrates with audio player and spectrogram canvas
- Includes TV denoising option
- Updates spectrogram display after filtering
- Maintains compatibility with both old and new audio player interfaces

### 4. Date/Time Parser ✅
**Problem:** The modern GUI wasn't parsing timestamps from filenames.

**Solution:**
- Updated `load_file()` method in main window
- Now imports and uses `parse_times_from_filename` from utils
- Correctly extracts pixel ID, start time, and end time from filename
- Falls back to current time if filename doesn't match expected format
- Properly sets annotation metadata with parsed information

### 5. CSV Integration ✅
**Problem:** CSV export wasn't working due to date/time parsing issues.

**Solution:**
- Fixed by resolving the date/time parser issue
- Event annotator now correctly saves timestamps in CSV format
- Annotations include proper datetime strings
- CSV export includes all required fields: Start, End, Site, Pixel, Type, Description, Frequency, Amplitude

## File Changes Summary

### Modified Files:
1. `/workspace/spectrogram_gui/gui_modern/spectrogram_canvas.py`
   - Fixed axes orientation
   - Added detection track plotting

2. `/workspace/spectrogram_gui/gui_modern/main_window_complete.py`
   - Added proper detector integration
   - Fixed file loading with timestamp parsing
   - Added spectrogram_params for detector
   - Updated filter dialog integration

### New Files Created:
1. `/workspace/spectrogram_gui/gui_modern/detector_dialog_fixed.py`
   - Proper detector parameter dialog

2. `/workspace/spectrogram_gui/gui_modern/filter_dialog_fixed.py`
   - Working filter dialog with audio integration

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Spectrogram Display:**
   - Load an audio file and verify frequency is on Y-axis, time on X-axis
   - Zoom and pan to verify axes remain correct

2. **Detection:**
   - Open detector dialog and adjust parameters
   - Run detection and verify yellow tracks appear over detected events
   - Test with different parameter settings

3. **Filters:**
   - Apply high-pass, low-pass, and band-pass filters
   - Verify spectrogram updates after filtering
   - Test TV denoising option

4. **Date/Time & CSV:**
   - Load files with timestamp in filename (format: pixel-XXX-YYYY-DD-MM HH-MM-SS-YYYY-DD-MM HH-MM-SS)
   - Create annotations and export to CSV
   - Verify CSV contains correct timestamps

## Notes
- The modern GUI now properly interfaces with the existing detector and filter utilities
- All fixes maintain backward compatibility with the old GUI logic
- The visual styling of the modern GUI is preserved while fixing functionality
